# first-missing-positive-integer
This repository contains an efficient solution to the **First Missing Positive Integer** problem — a classic algorithm challenge often asked in technical interviews at top tech companies.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

. Given an unsorted array of integers, return the smallest missing **positive** integer.
. You must implement an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** extra space.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-2³¹ <= nums[i] <= 2³¹ - 1`
- The array can contain duplicates, negative numbers, and zero.
